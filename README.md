# GL fragment shader viewer (in Python with PyGlet)

Use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage the code.

## install

```shell
> poetry install
```

## run

```shell
> poetry run viewer
```

You can visualize fragment shaders from the really impressive GLSL Sandbox Gallery (http://glslsandbox.com/).

Copy paste fragment shader source code on a local file and use:

```shell
> poetry run viewer -frag [path to fragment shader file]
```
